                <p>But I've never been to the moon! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for
                    us to interfere in his life. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two
                    consenting adults.</p>

                    Claus! Do a flip! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay
                    you or let you go.</p>

                    Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Shinier than yours, meatbag.</p>
